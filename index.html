<u><h1> About Me </h1> </u>
<p> I am an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. I was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer. I am widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.  Despite these accomplishments, I was  never fully recognised in my home country due to the prevalence of homophobia at the time and because much of my work was covered by the Official Secrets Act.
